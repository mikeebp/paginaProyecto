Define your audience(s)
•	Kids between 4 -12 years old. 
         We chose this audience for different reason, principally because kids are easier to educate and 
         influence about how to be health with the use of the technology. Why no younger? Because at this 
         age kids start to read and some parts are necessary to be understand. Also our audience has to have a computer and internet.
         
         Why not teenagers?  At this age is more difficult to convince and change their form of think because 
         is a period when persons develop their feelings, ideas.
•	
         Place: México, principally Jalisco. We are going to star 
         our project in the State of Jalisco then if everything going right, we would extended.
	
	Doctors who are going to supervise the process and they are our means to introduce our page and idea. 
	Why not the parents? Doctors have the knowledge and the tools necessary to check the process and parents 
	maybe can’t know about this application.

-Functionality
•	Our team are going to make an app/web that consists in a kind of game for kids, 
         the good thing it’s that if you synchronize with a glocometer that game will check your stats in real life
         and will give you some “rewards” because you reach your goals. Doctors are going to check the process
         of kids and they are going to analyze by glucometer the level of sugar. 
•	This game is going to help us to maintain a rating about kids in Mexico and know where is more dangerous
         for people that have Diabetes.

-Why? /Context
         What is Diabetes?
         Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, 
         either because the pancreas dos not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced.
         Diabetes is the result of the obesity. 
         Mexico is recognized as “the most obese” from America and the world. 
         About 70 percent of Mexican adults are overweight and childhood obesity tripled in a decade and about a third of teenager are fat.
         Information got it from the ONU.
         Our purpose it to combated the obesity since childhood. Kids must be educate to be capable of care their health.

- Problem(s) to be solve.
•	Our purpose is to decrease the percentage of people with diabetes and obesity by new generations.
•	If kids have an educations about how to eat and be healthy,
         they would change the number of diabetes and obesity in Mexico.
